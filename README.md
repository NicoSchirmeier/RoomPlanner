# RoomPlanner
Java based room planning app

Hi there.
This is a simple and easy to use room planning app.
It is 2d only and requires you to have measurements of your furniture and rooms. 

Before you can start planning make sure you have a version of Java installed (https://www.java.com/)
Just double click the RoomPlanner.jar and you should be ready to go.

The app is able to load multiple files at the same time so you can have your furniture in a seperate file.
This is useful whenever you move so you do not have to add all you furniture by hand again. 

RIGHT-Click to rotate
Hover to see sizes.

might add the source code later.

Hope you enjoy.
